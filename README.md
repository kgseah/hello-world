### File Descriptions

- **.github/workflows/workflow.ci.yml**: This file defines the GitHub Actions workflow for Continuous Integration (CI). It checks out the repository, sets up Python, installs dependencies, runs the application, and uploads artifacts.

- **app.py**: This is the main Python application file. It prints "Hello, World!" to the console, logs the message to a file (`app.log`), and makes an HTTP request using the `requests` library.

- **Dockerfile**: This file contains the instructions to build a Docker image for the application. It sets up a Python environment, installs dependencies, and runs `app.py`.

- **README.md**: This file. It provides an overview of the project, including the purpose of each file and instructions for setting up and running the application.

- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the Python dependencies required by the application. In this case, it includes the `requests` library.
